                        My name is <a href="https://nozzlegear.com/about">Joshua Harms</a>, and I built this application because I needed a way to get alerts when new subscribers joined my ConvertKit list. I'd be a poor ConvertKit user if I didn't mention that I'm writing <a href="https://nozzlegear.com/shopify-development-handbook?ref=ConvertKitForWindows">The Shopify Development Handbook</a>, a premium course for building Shopify apps and integrations with C# and ASP.NET.

                        This application is an <strong>unofficial</strong> port of <a href="https://convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> for the universal Windows platform. It's built with <a href="https://github.com/winjs/winjs">WinJS</a>, an implementation of HTML, JavaScript and TypeScript that runs both natively in Windows and can be loaded as a library in the browser. In Windows, a WinJS app is both first-class and native, which means the app runs on bare metal rather than being loaded through a performance-killing webview like you'd find on iOS or Android.

                        ConvertKit for Windows is open source. You can view the code, make edits, pull requests or just build it for yourself at <a href="https://github.com/nozzlegear/ConvertKitForWindows">https://github.com/nozzlegear/ConvertKitForWindows</a>
